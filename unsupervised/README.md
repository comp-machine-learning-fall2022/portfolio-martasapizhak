### Here: Unsupervised algorithms, using cold coding and off shelf
#### will discuss capabilities and limits around k-means, spectral clustering
Plan:
*     what k means can do -- group into separate groups -- visible if plotted, invisible to computer
*     what spectral clustering can do that kmeans can't -- separate if there's no clear batches, but some kind of circular agglomeration
