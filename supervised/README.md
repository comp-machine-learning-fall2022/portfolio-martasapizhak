### Here supervised algos, offshelf methods, cross val, time & benchmarking
#### will discuss potential and limitations for supervised algorithms
Plan:
* what kNN can do that clustering can't -- classify a point but need labels -- better than iterating over the same set every time in kmeans
* what svm can do that kNN can't -- faster, knn more accurate, limited to patterns and is parametric -- even faster

clustering vs classification.
If you have data but have no way to organize the data into meaningful groups, then clustering makes sense.
