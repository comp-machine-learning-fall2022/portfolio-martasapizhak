### TLDR; 
Hi, I'm Marta and this repo is a short summary of what I've learned in my ML
class this semester.

### Intro
I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Smith college. 
This semester I took a Machine Learning course. My final goal of this course is building
a portfolio that showcases some of my recently acquired skills and knowledge.

### Stuff I've learned recently
Over this time I worked with basic Machine Learning algorithms and concepts, coded 
them from scratch and gained skills of using ML and Data Science Python libraries. 

#### Some of the libraries I used are:
- matplotlib 
- seaborn
- numpy 
- scikit-learn 
- pandas
- pytest

####  Some of the algorithms I have learned to develop from scratch and to use the off-shelf solutions for are: 
- k-means
- Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition for dimension reduction
- k-Nearest Neighbours
- Gradient Descent
- Linear regression
- Cross Validation
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest 

#### Some of concepts I'm now familiar more in depth with include:
- Unsupervised vs Supervised ML
- Parameters vs hyperparameters
- Training vs Testing in supervised ML
- Benchmarking
- Neural Nets

 Outside of that I've had an opportunity to familiarize myself with Google Colaboratory, 
Tensor Flow and GitHub actions -- Python application testing CI.

### I'm pretty much a newbie
I'm relatively new to Machine Learning as a field, however I'm looking forward to 
progressing further and integrating ML into my pet projects.

### What do I do
Outside of my passion for computer science I love rock climbing, working out and crafts.
Beyond machine learning, I'm interested in developing software that allows to make 
processes more efficient and simplify tasks completion.
